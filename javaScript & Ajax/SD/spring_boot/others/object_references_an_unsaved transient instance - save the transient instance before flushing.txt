object_references_an_unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing
========================================================================================


You should include cascade="all" (if using xml) or cascade=CascadeType.ALL (if using annotations) on your collection mapping.

This happens because you have a collection in your entity, and that collection has one or more items which are not present in the database. 
By specifying the above options you tell hibernate to 
save them to the database when saving their parent.
