With Eclipse.

	1. Install Jasper Studio from market place.(It is requiredd for report design)
	2. Add dependency in your pom.xml


	<dependency>
    	<groupId>net.sf.jasperreports</groupId>
    	<artifactId>jasperreports</artifactId>
    	<version>6.5.0</version>
	</dependency>

Standalone Application

It is advised to design report using standalone jasper studio. As in eclipse (embedded), it response quite slow.
